# positconf-roundtables-2023

## Background

In 2018 and 2019, R in Pharma was in-person at Harvard University and focused on opportunities for direct interaction with speakers and guests. These relationships and connections have grown into many exciting areas of Open Source drug development. We are excited to announce R/Pharma is partnering with Posit to host our in-person portion at posit::conf(2023) in Chicago. There will be a Pharma workshop on Sunday Sept 17, and on the 18th of September we will be hosting the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit. 

Over the last 5 years we’ve seen an explosive growth in the use of R and other open source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on open source projects and pan-company collaboration. In this 1-day series of roundtables we aim to provide an open, collaborative, and inclusive environment to share learnings, understand common themes across our industry, and establish collaboration opportunities. The focus of the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit is to foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, submissions etc.) as we did at Harvard.

We’ll start the day with a 90 minute workshop on a new validated repository for GxP R use, facilitated by R Validation Hub lead, Doug Kelhlkoff. For the remainder of the day, the format will be participant driven, with an aim to collectively refine a series of topics amongst the participants. Suggested topics motivating these round tables include:

- Accommodating our 10-year commitment to reproducibility of GxP insights as we transition from proprietary to open source backboned data science
- Preparing for a new standard of multi-modal data science, ensuring provenance across imaging, genomics, digital biomarkers, CRF and routinely collected data
- Managing legacy file system patient data and permissions in modern data science stacks
- Bridging statistical computing environments for clinical reporting, with scientific computing environments for drug discovery and personalized health care?
- Fostering strong communities and collaboration between companies for corporate sponsored open sourced packages that are business critical
- Building a case to invest our talent in contributing to open source
- Measuring the positive impact of open source collaborations and contributions?
